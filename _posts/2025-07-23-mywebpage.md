I made this webpage using the al folio jekyll theme. I forked the repository and deployed the webpage using github pages on my username.github.io. 

In about 5 minutes, the gh-pages branch was created which I set as the deploy branch. I also needed to give read write prviledges under settings/actions/general. 

To work on it locally, I am using the dev container that they have already provided me with.

I am excited to use this page for documenting my insights, projects and sharing them with you!
